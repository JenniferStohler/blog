The first div still runs, but it doesn't get printed out because it's overruled by the second div. However, if the code were to have the 1st div as div.property and the 2nd code as .property, the rule of Specificty dictates that only the 1st div will print out. This is because it is targeting an element and a class instead of just one or the other.
